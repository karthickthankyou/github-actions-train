  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch

    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
